<hr />

<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>The first movie I ever fell in love with. I watched it when I was 8 and then watched it on my birthday every year after.</p>
<H3>I Love you man</H3>
<p>The best rom-com of all time. It is an absolute classic and I watch it whenever I feel down or im poorly</p>
<h3>Thor Ragnarok</h3>
<p>It was the first movie I watched with poppet. Not only was it an amazing film but it was also one of the earliest moments in which I realised that I was in love with her.</p>
